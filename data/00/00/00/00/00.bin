  |   Endless modes.                                                        |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Here's the full rundown on both:                                      |

  |   Y'all ToeJam & Earl veterans wanted a more retro difficulty similar   |
  |   to the original game, and the guys heard that too. Finishing the      |
  |   Hard World now unlocks Extreme, which offers 25 levels filled with    |
  |   more broken presents, progressively harder, faster and smarter        |
  |   enemies, changes to all characters' stats, and gameplay much, MUCH    |
  |   harder than v1.0. Don't forget the first ToeJam and Earl is           |
  |   available on the SEGA Genesis Mini so you can compare the             |
  |   difficulties directly.                                                |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Endless World is unlocked after reaching level 10 on Extreme World.   |
  |   Strap on some rocket skates, rack up a bunch of tomatoes, and get     |
  |   to work. Endless has over 1000 levels! Exactly 1001, in fact. Go      |
  |   beyond the maximum rank of 'Funklord' and level up the characters     |
  |   to strengths not possible in the core game, the Endless World         |
  |   equals Endless amount of fun.                                         |
